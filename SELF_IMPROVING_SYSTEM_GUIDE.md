## Self-Improving System Guide

1. Keep `SELF_IMPROVING_AGENTS.py` up-to-date with new agent behaviors; run `./python3 SELF_IMPROVING_AGENTS.py` after modifications.
2. Log experiments via `generated_content/action_feed.md` so the automated agents have history.
3. When new patterns are created, append them to `ai_collaboration_patterns.json` and re-run `agent_communication_system.py`.
