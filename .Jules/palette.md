## 2026-01-31 - [Dashboard Accessibility & Interactivity]
**Learning:** Interactive dashboards in this repo often use simple HTML/JS without formal frameworks, making accessibility labels and ARIA roles critical for screen reader compatibility as they are easily missed. Additionally, adding simple utility features like "Copy to Clipboard" significantly improves user efficiency in data-heavy interfaces.
**Action:** Always check for `placeholder`-only inputs and modal containers that lack standard ARIA dialog roles. Implement visual feedback (e.g., "Copied!" state) for all clipboard interactions to ensure the user is aware of the successful action.
